This is a fork of the original MantisKanban plugin which can be found here: https://github.com/thinksentient/MantisKanban
Since the plugin is not maintained and didn't work "out of the box" I've decided to fork, fix and extend it a bit.

<h2>New features in version 1.1.:</h2>
<ul>
<li>fixed the base plugin, should run now "out of the box"</li>
<li>added AJAX support: you can now change the ticket status from the Kanban board via AJAX dropdown</li>
<li>made the tickets sortable by date or by priority</li>
<li>added alternative / optional view for "All projects" (separate row for each project)</li>
<li>added "work in progress" limits per column - if limit is reached, the column becomes red</li>
<li>made column titles multilingual</li>
<li>uses the most important filters from the general list view in Mantis (selected user etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>Upload the "MantisKanban" folder to your Mantis "plugins" folder</li>
<li>Activate the plugin in your Mantis backend</li>
<li>edit "pages/kanban_page.php" and define at least your desired colums and "wip" limits. (see the
"$colums" array)</li>

</ul>
