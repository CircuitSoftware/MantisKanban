This is a fork of the original MantisKanban plugin which can be found here: https://github.com/thinksentient/MantisKanban
Since the plugin is not maintained and didn't work "out of the box" I've decided to fork, fix and extend it a bit.

New features in version 1.1.:
- fixed the base plugin, should run now "out of the box"
- added AJAX support: you can now change the ticket status from the Kanban board via AJAX dropdown
- made the tickets sortable by date or by priority
- added alternative / optional view for "All projects" (separate row for each project)
- added "work in progress" limits per column - if limit is reached, the column becomes red
- made column titles multilingual
- uses the most important filters from the general list view in Mantis (selected user etc.)

Usage
- Upload the "MantisKanban" folder to your Mantis "plugins" folder
- Activate the plugin in your Mantis backend
- edit "pages/kanban_page.php" and define at least your desired colums and "wip" limits. (see the
"$colums" array)
